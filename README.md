# discord-commits
A GitHub action that publishes any commits to Discord

# Key Differences
- Webhook avatar matches the commiter's profile picture
- Private commits that will be hidden with random blocks
- Commits will be split up under 2000 characters, so all of your commits will show up
- Active development :heart:

# Getting Started
- Create a `.yml` file under `.github/workflows` with this code below
```yml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Discord webhook
      uses: itz-coffee/discord-commits@v2.0.1
      with:
        webhookUrl: ${{ secrets.DISCORD_WEBHOOK }}
```
- Add your discord webhook as a secret named `discord_webhook`
- Any commits starting with a `!` or `$` will be private
